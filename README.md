# AIM Winning Project

IT and business administrators are having some trouble creating an infrastructure in the cloud to deploy their applications, websites, or blogs to improve their online presence. The team has been required to create an application to facilitate the creation of an infrastructure in AWS. The application must have a GUI so that most people, even with little or no experience in cloud services can make use of it. 

The diagram shows the network.
